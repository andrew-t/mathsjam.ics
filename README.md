# mathsjam.ics
An ICS calendar for Mathsjam

[MathsJam](http://www.mathsjam.com) meets on the second-to-last Tuesday of the month. (For Americans, [MathJelly](http://www.mathjam.com) meets on the second-last Toosday of the month.)

Most Calendar editors don't let you input that rule, but many do support it, so try importing [http://github.andrewt.net/mathsjam.ics/mathsjam.ics](this file) directly.
